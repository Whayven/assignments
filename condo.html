            <dd>Our luxury condos are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each condo has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
            <dt><b>How are the condos furnished?</b></dt>
            <dd>
                Each condo is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.  Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            <dd>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.  it's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
